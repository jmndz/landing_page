# Landing Page

This project is about creating an entire webpage using the skills learnt in The Odin Project HTML and CSS Foundations. 

## Example design and styles:

<img src="./img_github/odin-project.png" width="500"/>
<img src="./img_github/colors_and_stuff.png" width="500"/>

## Final Outcome:
[Live Demo](https://jmndz.github.io/landing_page)

## Thoughts:

I thoroughly enjoyed every second spent making this website. Still needs a lot of work but I'm pretty happy with it for now.
